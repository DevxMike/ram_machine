Whole project is about creating a simple RAM machine simulator.
Me and Mark are making this just for fun, and after this we will create a simple operating system.

Documentation of app will appear soon below:

-stack lib
Simple data structure which consists of two structs:
data struct and call stack struct with availability to 
carry out operations on this abstract data structure.
Data struct holds pseudo assembly code command and operands of a single call.
Call stack struct hold informations such as size of call stack, 
quantity of elements being holded on a call stack and data struct 
pointer to an array with data.
Data should be allocated dynamically in main function 
(size of call stack must be defined by developer using this code).
